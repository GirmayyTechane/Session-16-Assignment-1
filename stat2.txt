#Session 16: Assignment 1
#Question 1 Problem Statement 1:
A test is conducted which is consisting of 20 MCQs (multiple choices questions) with
every MCQ having its four options out of which only one is correct. Determine the
probability that a person undertaking that test has answered exactly 5 questions wrong.
#Answer
Here, n = 20, n - r = 5, r = 20 - 5 = 15

the probability of success = P(s) = 1/4

and the probability of failure = p(f) = 1 - s = 1 - 1/4 = 3/4

When we substitute these values in the formula for Binomial distribution we get,

So, P (exactly 5 out of 20 answers incorrect) = C (20, 5) * (1/4)power15 * (3/4)power55

→→ P (5 out of 20) = ((20∗19∗18∗17∗16)/(5∗4∗3∗2∗1)) * (1/4)power15 * (3/4)power55

= 0.0000034 (approximately)

Thus the required probability is 0.0000034 approximately.

#Problem Statement 2:
#A die marked A to E is rolled 50 times. Find the probability of getting a “D” exactly 5 times.

#Answer.
Here, n = 50, r = 5, n - r = 4/5.


The probability of success = probability of getting a “D”= s = 1/5

Hence, the probability of failure = probability of not getting a “D” = 1 - s = 4/5.


#Problem Statement 3:

#Two balls are drawn at random in succession without replacement from an urn
#containing 4 red balls and 6 black balls.
#Find the probabilities of all the possible outcomes

Answer.

First determine the probabilities of the events.

  events           Probability
    RR          (4/10)(3/9) = 2/15
    RB          (4/10)(6/9) = 4/15
    BR          (6/10)(4/9) = 4/15 
    BB          (6/10)(5/9) = 1/3

The probability of 0 blue balls (RR)is 2/15
The probability of 1 blue ball is (RB or BR) is 4/15+4/15 = 8/15
The probability of 2 blue balls (BB) is 1/3

So the probability distribution is:

Z   p(Z)
--------   
0   2/15
1   8/15
2   1/3
